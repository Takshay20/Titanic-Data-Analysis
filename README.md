# Titanic-Data-Analysis
– the Titanic Dataset. This dataset contains passenger details (age, class, gender, etc.) and whether they survived. Your task is to analyze survival patterns and visualize them.
What You’ll Build (Requirements)
1. Load Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
2. Clean data (handle missing values like Age).
3. Answer questions such as:
o Who survived more: males or females?
o Did passenger class affect survival chances?
o What was the survival rate by age group?
4. Visualize using Seaborn / Matplotlib:
o Bar chart of survival by gender.
o Bar chart of survival by class.
o Histogram of passenger ages.
Why This Task Is Important
o Teaches you how to handle real-world messy data.
o Introduces data visualization, a key skill for Data Scientists.
o Helps you practice asking and answering business questions with data.
